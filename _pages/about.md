<p> Hi there! I'm Gongfan Fang, currently a third-year Ph.D. Candidate at the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/xml-nus">xML Lab</a> @ National University of Singapore, under the supervision of <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/sitexinchaowang/"> <b> Prof. Xinchao Wang (Presidential Young Professor) </b> </a> . Prior to joining LV Lab, I earned my Bachelor’s degree in 2019 and subsequently completed my Master’s degree in 2022 at the <a href="https://www.vipazoo.cn/">Visual Intelligence and Pattern Analysis (VIPA) Lab</a> @ Zhejiang University, adviced by <a href="https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/msong"> <b>Prof. Mingli Song</b> </a>. </p>

<p> My research focuses on <strong>Efficient Deep Learning</strong> and <strong>Generative Models</strong>. I'm also actively contributing to several open-source projects such as <strong><a href="https://github.com/VainF/Torch-Pruning">Torch-Pruning</a></strong>, a framework for neural network pruning.</p>
