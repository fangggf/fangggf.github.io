<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p>Hi there! I'm Gongfan Fang, a final-year Ph.D. candidate at the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/xml-nus">xML Lab</a>, National University of Singapore, supervised by <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/sitexinchaowang/"><b>Prof. Xinchao Wang (Presidential Young Professor)</b></a>. I received my B.Eng. (2019) and M.Eng. (2022) from the <a href="https://www.vipazoo.cn/">VIPA Lab</a>, Zhejiang University, advised by <a href="https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/msong"><b>Prof. Mingli Song</b></a>.</p>


<p> I'm currently working on <strong>Efficient Large Language Models and GenAI</strong>, with emphasis on LLM Reasoning, Model Efficiency, and Diffusion Language Models. I'm also the creator and lead developer of <strong><a href="https://github.com/VainF/Torch-Pruning">Torch-Pruning</a></strong>, a top framework for accelerating foundation models, which has been intergated into many industrial products like NVIDIA TAO <a href="https://docs.nvidia.com/tao/tao-toolkit/text/acknowledgements.html#vainf-torch-pruning">(See the ACK)</a>. During my PhD, I previously worked with the amazing <strong><a href="https://nv-dler.github.io/team/">DLER</a></strong> team at NVIDIA. And I was awarded the <strong><a href="https://scholarship.bytedance.com/en/winner/2024">2024 ByteDance Scholarship</a></strong> (10~15 recipients per year). </p>

<strong>I'm currently on the job market and open to both academic and industrial opportunities starting in <em>March 2026</em>. Please feel free to reach out via email (gongfan at u.nus.edu) if thereâ€™s a potential fit.</strong>
