<p> Hi there! I'm Gongfan Fang, currently a last-year Ph.D. Candidate at the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/xml-nus">xML Lab</a> @ National University of Singapore, under the supervision of <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/sitexinchaowang/"> <b> Prof. Xinchao Wang (Presidential Young Professor) </b> </a>. Before joining xML Lab, I earned my Bachelor’s degree in 2019 and completed my Master’s degree in 2022 at the <a href="https://www.vipazoo.cn/">Visual Intelligence and Pattern Analysis (VIPA) Lab</a> @ Zhejiang University, adviced by <a href="https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/msong"> <b>Prof. Mingli Song</b></a>. 

<p> My research focuses on <strong>LLMs, Diffusion and Efficient Generative Models</strong>. My recent focuses include LLM Reasoning, LLM Efficiency, and Diffusion Language Models. I'm also the creator and lead developer of <strong><a href="https://github.com/VainF/Torch-Pruning">Torch-Pruning</a></strong>, a top framework for compressing foundation models. During my PhD, I previously worked with the amazing <strong><a href="https://nv-dler.github.io/team/">DLER</a></strong> team at NVIDIA. And I was awarded the <strong><a href="https://scholarship.bytedance.com/en/winner/2024">2024 ByteDance Scholarship</a></strong> (10~15 recipients per year). </p>

<strong>I'm currently on the job market and open to both academic and industrial opportunities starting in <em>March 2026</em>. Please feel free to reach out via email (gongfan at u.nus.edu) if there’s a potential fit.</strong>
